    "### Broad Question\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Predictive Question\n",
    "Which combination of player features — such as **age**, **gender**, **experience level**, **total playtime**, and **average session duration (avg_session_min)** — best predicts whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter, and how much does each factor contribute to improving the prediction accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Data Help\n",
    "The `players.csv` dataset includes each player's demographic information (`Age`, `gender`), self-reported experience level (`experience`), total playtime (`played_hours`), and subscription status (`subscribe`).  \n",
    "The `sessions.csv` dataset records detailed play sessions, from which we can calculate each player's **average session duration (`avg_session_min`)**.  \n",
    "These combined data allow us to test how demographic and behavioural features, both individually and together, relate to subscription behaviour and which combinations produce the most accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling Plan\n",
    "- Use both `players.csv` and `sessions.csv` datasets.  \n",
    "- Keep `subscribe` as the variable we aim to predict.  \n",
    "- Use `Age`, `gender`, `experience`, `played_hours`, and `avg_session_min` as predictors, testing different feature combinations.  \n",
    "- Handle missing values (e.g., missing `Age` or incomplete session data) and ensure all categorical variables are properly encoded.  \n",
    "- Convert `experience` to a factor variable for classification.  \n",
    "- Calculate `avg_session_min` from session data as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  avg\\_session\\_min = \\frac{end\\_time - start\\_time}{\\text{number of sessions}}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- Split the final dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets, and compare model performance to identify which feature combination best predicts subscription.\n"

    "## (4) Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Method\n",
    "I plan to use a **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** classification model。\n",
    "The goal is to predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter (`subscribe`) based on demographic and behavioural features such as `Age`, `gender`, `experience`, `played_hours`, and `avg_session_min`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this method is appropriate\n",
    "KNN makes predictions based on the similarity between observations.  \n",
    "It does not assume any specific functional relationship between predictors and the response.  \n",
    "This makes it suitable for our data, where the relationship between player behaviour and subscription likelihood may be nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "- The data is representative of the population and independent across players.  \n",
    "- Predictors are scaled or normalized, so no variable dominates distance calculations.  \n",
    "- The dataset is relatively free of extreme outliers, which can distort distance measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Limitations\n",
    "- Model performance depends on the choice of **k** (number of neighbours). Too small a k may overfit, while too large may oversmooth patterns.  \n",
    "- Sensitive to irrelevant or highly correlated features.  \n",
    "- KNN can be slower for larger datasets, since distances must be computed for each prediction.  \n",
    "- It does not directly show which features are most influential, only overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Comparison and Selection\n",
    "I will tune the hyperparameter **k** using **cross-validation**, comparing accuracy scores for different values of k (e.g., k = 1–10).  \n",
    "The best-performing k will be chosen based on the lowest cross-validation error or highest accuracy on validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Plan\n",
    "Before modelling:\n",
    "1. Select relevant variables: `subscribe` (response), `Age`, `gender`, `experience`, `played_hours`, and `avg_session_min` (predictors).  \n",
    "2. Handle missing values and convert categorical variables (e.g., `gender`, `experience`) to factors.  \n",
    "3. Normalize quantitative predictors (`Age`, `played_hours`, `avg_session_min`) to ensure fair distance computation.  \n",
    "4. Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.  \n",
    "5. Use **5-fold cross-validation** on the training data to select the best k.  \n",
    "6. Evaluate model accuracy on the test data.\n",
