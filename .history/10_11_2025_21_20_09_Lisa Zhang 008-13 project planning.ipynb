    "### Broad Question\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Predictive Question\n",
    "Which combination of player features — such as **age**, **gender**, **experience level**, **total playtime**, and **average session duration (avg_session_min)** — best predicts whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter, and how much does each factor contribute to improving the prediction accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Data Help\n",
    "The `players.csv` dataset includes each player's demographic information (`Age`, `gender`), self-reported experience level (`experience`), total playtime (`played_hours`), and subscription status (`subscribe`).  \n",
    "The `sessions.csv` dataset records detailed play sessions, from which we can calculate each player's **average session duration (`avg_session_min`)**.  \n",
    "These combined data allow us to test how demographic and behavioural features, both individually and together, relate to subscription behaviour and which combinations produce the most accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling Plan\n",
    "- Use both `players.csv` and `sessions.csv` datasets.  \n",
    "- Keep `subscribe` as the variable we aim to predict.  \n",
    "- Use `Age`, `gender`, `experience`, `played_hours`, and `avg_session_min` as predictors, testing different feature combinations.  \n",
    "- Handle missing values (e.g., missing `Age` or incomplete session data) and ensure all categorical variables are properly encoded.  \n",
    "- Convert `experience` to a factor variable for classification.  \n",
    "- Calculate `avg_session_min` from session data as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  avg\\_session\\_min = \\frac{end\\_time - start\\_time}{\\text{number of sessions}}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- Split the final dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets, and compare model performance to identify which feature combination best predicts subscription.\n"

    "## (4) Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Method\n",
    "I plan to use a **classification model**, since the goal is to predict whether a player **subscribes to the newsletter (TRUE/FALSE)**.  \n",
    "The chosen method is **logistic regression**, which estimates the probability of subscription using player characteristics such as **age, gender, experience level, total playtime**, and possibly **session behaviour**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this method is appropriate\n",
    "Logistic regression is simple, interpretable, and suitable for binary outcomes.  \n",
    "It allows us to evaluate how each variable (e.g., experience or playtime) affects the likelihood of subscribing, which aligns with the project’s goal of understanding player behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "- Observations are independent (each player is treated as one observation).  \n",
    "- The relationship between predictors and the log-odds of subscription is approximately linear.  \n",
    "- The predictors are not perfectly correlated (no strong multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Limitations\n",
    "- The relationship between predictors and subscription might be nonlinear, which logistic regression may not fully capture.  \n",
    "- Missing or imbalanced data (e.g., few non-subscribers) could reduce model accuracy.  \n",
    "- Interaction effects between variables (e.g., experience × playtime) may need to be tested separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Comparison and Selection\n",
    "Model performance will be evaluated using **accuracy** and **cross-validation**.  \n",
    "I will compare models with different sets of predictors (e.g., demographics only vs. gameplay features) to find which combination predicts subscription most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Plan\n",
    "Before modelling, the data will be:\n",
    "1. Cleaned and encoded (convert categorical variables such as gender and experience to factors).  \n",
    "2. Split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.  \n",
    "3. The logistic regression model will be trained on the training data, and its performance tested on the test data.  \n",
    "4. Cross-validation will be used to ensure that the results are not due to random variation in the split.\n"
